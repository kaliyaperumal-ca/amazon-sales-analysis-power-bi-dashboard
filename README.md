CONCLUSION:

The Amazon E-commerce Sales Analysis reveals a well-diversified product performance with strong revenue and balanced regional distribution. Key product categories such as Food & Beverages and Electronic Accessories lead both in sales and profit, confirming their strategic value for growth and inventory prioritization.

Customer segmentation shows significant impact, with members contributing more consistently to both sales and profit, and showing higher resilience during downturns (e.g., February’s drop). This validates the effectiveness of the membership program and highlights the opportunity to increase member conversions.

The gender split is nearly even, but with a slight female majority, suggesting potential for targeted marketing strategies. Similarly, payment trends differ between customer types, indicating that expanding credit card offers to normal users could boost average transaction values.

City-wise performance is stable, but Naypyitaw outperforms in sales value, hinting at premium purchasing behavior. However, declining online activity in Yangon and Naypyitaw during February suggests the need for better digital engagement and localized interventions.

While overall sales remain strong, the February dip of -16.40% in both sales and profit underscores the need for proactive seasonal planning, better customer re-engagement, and improved retention strategies, especially for normal customers.
